<h1 align="middle"> Maze Solver </h1>

A simple maze solver made in python which uses [depth first search](https://github.com/Vaibhav-Kashyap07/maze-solver/blob/main/dfs.py) or [breadth first search](https://github.com/Vaibhav-Kashyap07/maze-solver/blob/main/bfs.py) to solve a maze.

> How to use

- Clone the Git to your local device
- Change the contents of maze.txt to your custom maze where `A` is starting point, `B` is Goal and `#` are walls.
- Choose an algorithm and run its particular file.
- An image named maze.png will be generated with the solution showed.

## Algorithms Summary

> [Depth First Search (DFS)](https://github.com/Vaibhav-Kashyap07/maze-solver/blob/main/dfs.py)

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree and goes as far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it.

> [Breadth First Search](https://github.com/Vaibhav-Kashyap07/maze-solver/blob/main/bfs.py)

Breadth-first search (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc. Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore "ripple out" from the starting point.
